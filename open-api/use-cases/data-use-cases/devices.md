# Working with Devices

We use the term _Devices_ to describe physical on-premise devices which we integrate into our cloud-native system, this includes key cutters or key encoders and also printers for printing hard-copy of guest bills.
Integration with such Devices is described in the [Device integrations use case](/connector-api/use-cases/device-integrations) in the [Mews Connector API](/connector-api).
