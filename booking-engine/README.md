# Mews Booking Engine Guide

Welcome to the online documentation for the **Mews Booking Engine**. We're here to guide you through the process of integrating the Mews Booking Engine into your website, so your guests can create reservations in your properties directly in **Mews Operations**.
You can do this in one of three ways:

- [Booking Engine Standalone](booking-engine-standalone/README.md)<br>Redirect to a standalone booking page hosted by Mews
- [Booking Engine Widget](booking-engine-widget/README.md)<br>Embed a JavaScript widget into your own website
- [Booking Engine API](booking-engine-api/README.md)<br>Create your own custom booking engine using the Booking Engine API

Not sure which option is right for you? See [Ways to integrate](FAQ/ways-to-integrate.md).
If you need further assistance, or have any questions or special requests, please open a ticket from Mews Operations via our Mews Digital Assistant.

> So if you see _Distributor_, this is synonymous with _Mews Booking Engine_.
