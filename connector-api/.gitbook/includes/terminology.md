### Terminology

Some of the terms used in the API, such as _enterprise_, _customer_ or _resource_ may not be familiar. For example, we use _resource_ to describe guest rooms and other types of bookable space. For a full description of all the terms used, see the [Mews Glossary for Open API users](https://app.gitbook.com/s/HKZkojyobXIJtRpzALEf/getting-started/glossary).
