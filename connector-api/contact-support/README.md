# Contact support

Partner Success team is ready to help you with any questions about API behavior, clarification of documentation, technical troubleshooting, and general guidance on integrations.

## Technical issues

If you are experiencing a problem with the API, we recommend first reviewing the following resources, as many common issues can be resolved there:
- [Best practices](../guidelines/best-practices.md)
- [Response troubleshooting](../guidelines/responses.md)

To help us investigate and respond as quickly as possible, please include the following details when reporting an issue:

- Full API response body including the `RequestId` property in the [Error response details](../guidelines/responses.md#error-response-details).
- The request body you are sending and the response you are receiving, provided in JSON format, with `ClientToken` and `AccessToken` values redacted (e.g. replaced with empty string or leaving just a few characters).
  Avoid sending screenshots or document files (for example Word or PDF files).
- Do not send full `ClientToken`, `AccessToken`, or any other sensitive information (e.g. guests' personal data in request payload). Partner success will never ask for this information.

If you have any questions or encounter issues, contact partner success at [partnersuccess@mews.com](mailto:partnersuccess@mews.com).
