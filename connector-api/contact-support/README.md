# Contact support

Before reaching out, make sure you are following all our [Best practices](../guidelines/best-practices.md), and review the [Response troubleshooting](../guidelines/responses.md) section, as many common issues can be resolved there.

To help us investigate and respond as quickly as possible, include the following information:

- Full API response body including the `RequestId` property in the [Error response details](../guidelines/responses.md#error-response-details).
- The request body you are sending or the response you are receiving, provided in JSON format, with `ClientToken` and `AccessToken` values redacted (e.g. replaced with empty string or leaving just a few characters).
  Avoid sending screenshots or document files (for example Word or PDF files).
- Do not send full `ClientToken`, `AccessToken`, or any other sensitive information (e.g. guests' personal data in request payload). Partner success will never ask for this information.

If you have any questions or encounter issues, contact partner success at [partnersuccess@mews.com](mailto:partnersuccess@mews.com).
